	This is help play the game by actually seeing what's going
	on.

	MOVE order needs fixing about not reporting illegal hex etc.

1999-02-20: Start of new lizards.
	This involves splitting features from terrain leaving the following
	terrain features: PLAIN, WATER, SWAMP, PEAK & SCRUB.  The features
	are DEN, HOMEDEN, BAND, TEMPLE, RUIN, RAFT, BRIDGE, FERTILE,
	VOLCANO, WHIRLPOOL & CURSED.

	Spies are currently treated although the only reason is that
	there can be more than one spy per hex.  Better to leave spies
	alone for the moment.

	Complete TERRMAST in libturn.
