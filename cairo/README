In the original map_t structure the hexes where allocated all together
as a single block of memory.  With the grid_t structure it is just an
array of hex_t pointers, so it is possible to have undefined hexes (ie
nul pointers).  Therefore when layouts are realized they only contain
those hexes which are marked in the layout, leaving the rest as nul
pointers.
