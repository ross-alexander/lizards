This is a test of lizards 

Notes:

* Lizards is made up of a number of objects.  
  + Hexes (or provinces).
  + Bands.
  + Monsters.
  + Features.

* Originally hexes (from now on provinces) were of a fixes topology.  This
  meant lots of extra code checking if the world wraps.  Since wrapping is
  all setup in the creation, it is sensible that all the hard work is done
  then.  The structure of a Province is the following.

	(Province (
		Name
		Owner
		Borders (
			Name
			Direction
			Adjacent )
		
	))

* To keep everything tidy an OO-relational model is used with strings
  naming everything.  However, during runtime this would probably cause
  a heavy performance penalty.  Using indexes would help but having a
  network model would make coding simple.  During runtime one can avoid
  referencing by using pointers.
